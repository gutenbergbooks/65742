                          RED, WHITE AND BLUE

Guests are to write the names of different objects or facts that are
associated with the colors red, white and blue. It might be specified
that they write the names of red vegetables (beets, tomatoes, red
cabbage, etc.), names of variations of the color white (off white,
oyster white, blue white, etc.). For blue the guests can name all of the
blue objects in the room in which they are sitting. The colors can be
used for other listings such as blue flowers or white precious stones.


                             HEART ARCHERY

Draw a large 30 inch heart on cardboard. Make circles of diminishing
size on heart to make target. The inner ring is labeled “heart smasher,”
the next to the center one is “lovers,” next is “somewhat affectionate,”
then outside this is “indifferent to love,” and the outside one is
titled “woman or man hater.” Guests are each given one try with toy bow
and arrow or with darts. The circle that they hit will indicate the
state of their heart.


                         PULLING HEART STRINGS

Cut hole in center of large red cardboard heart. Put long red strings
through the hole and place heart on top of a screen or door with boys on
one side and girls on the other. Have a string for each couple. Each boy
takes one end of a string and each girl takes one of the strings on the
other side of the heart. Heart is pulled from top of the screen and
after the strings are untangled, the partners for the next game are
found.

                        BARNYARD EASTER EGG HUNT

Choose two sides, each captained by a child. Players hunt for Easter
eggs but only the two leaders, the Hens, can touch them. When a girl
finds an egg, she must cluck until the leader comes to pick up the egg.
Boys will crow when they find an egg. When they have all been found,
each side counts eggs to gain the total. Each child in the group with
the largest amount can be given a specially decorated egg or bunny for a
prize. Of course, divide the eggs that have been found among the members
of each team.


                           POTATO ROLL RELAY

Mark two four-inch circles 5 feet apart on the floor to designate the
goals in the relay. Choose sides and give the leader of each side an
irregularly shaped potato and a table knife. The players, in turn, must
roll the potato from one circle to the other and back again with the aid
of the knife. Judges can check to make sure that the potato is in the
circle each time. As each player comes back to the starting point, he
hands the knife to the next player and the relay goes on.


                         NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH

Guests sit in a circle. Each guest, in turn, asks each one of the other
guests a question which must be answered truthfully. The answer may be
yes or no, or the truth may be evaded, but an untruth cannot be told.
Fines can be imposed upon those who might make a misstatement.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
